# Introduction #

JavaRosa takes XForms definitions and allows a user to enter data into those forms in a mobile phone.
It saves the data locally and then exchanges it with a backend or another phone with a transport.
Mesh4x is one of the supported transports in JavaROSA, including sync via XML/HTTP for GPRS or internet-enabled phones, or sync over SMS for phones with no internet acccess.
